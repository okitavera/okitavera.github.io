In a some cases, itâ€™s okay to give people constructive criticism.
But honesty saying to someone that they are ignorant, immature, and narrow minded is just mean and a form of bullying.

When you says that to others, it imply an offensive message.
The words can certainly be used in a kindly fashion, suggesting sympathy for some perceived vulnerability.
But in a context of willful derision and insult,
They are clearly having an ad hominems, with an added implication of a psychiatric condition related to a disorder or mental illness.

I know, Asking people to stop doing is pretty much impossible.
But we need to be mindful of the damage that we can inflict when we invoke psychiatric diagnostic terms during our riffs of nastiness.
Sadly, that's how bullying nowadays, especially in the internet, where the basest words are meant to inflict maximum pain with minimal thought.   

In conclusion, attempts to change others behaviour means you haven't thought about how other people react.
Instead of making the condition better, you decide to offended someone,
even if they deserved it, we'll have done nothing to change the situation.
Besides, we may have made it worse, for real.

So, If we want to change them, we should lead them by loving kindness.
Remember, We are responsible of our own behaviour first, not the others.
By changing ourselves, we are being a better person,
And maybe, affects other peoples in our live.
